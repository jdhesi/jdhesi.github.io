I'm currently a first year PhD student in the Department of Pure Mathematics and Mathematical Statistics (DPMMS) at the University of Cambridge.  My research areas include topological data analysis, inverse problems and machine learning. Before this I studied Mathematics at the University of Oxford. For a full list of my education and courses taken please see my [about page](about). My website highlights some of my personal and academic projects.

## Publications
- [**Relational persistent homology for multispecies data with application to the tumor microenvironment**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06205](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11538-024-01353-6)

- [**Topological classification of tumour-immune interactions and dynamics (preprint)**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05294)

## Projects
Here are some of my projects. For some more in depth summaries, please check the projects page.

- [**Using Topological Data Analysis to Interpret Cancer Images.**](projects/tdaproject) Using existing and novel methods from TDA to analyse an agent based model describing the immune response to tumours. We use ML techniques to perform a binary classification task and a regression task of the topological feature vectors and improve upon benchmark accuracies set by more conventional statistics. 

- [**Approximating $$C^{\infty}$$ Nowhere Analytic Functions.**](projects/aofproject) Investigating convergence rates of the polynomial approximation to different classes of continuous functions. We review theorems for continuously differentiable functions and analytic functions. We then investigate $$C^{\infty}$$ nowehere analytic functions. We derive some new theoretical bounds on a subclass of these niche functions and verify our bounds computationally using Matlab.

- [**Modelling Higher-Order Interactions with Simplicial Complexes.**](projects/smproject) We investigate various analogues of the Erdős–Rényi random network for simplicial complexes. We derive the degree distributions for one particular generalisation of the ER graph and verify it numerically. We then investigate the importance of higher order interactions by building SIR models on our random simplicial complexes and compare results to the case for graphs. Computations done using the NetworkX Python library.

- [**Investigating Image Colour Recovery Using Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces.**](projects/optimproject) We use functional analysis and optimisation to recolour grey-scale images given colour information at a small number of pixels. We investigate the impact of different parameters in the colour recovery process. 

- [**Implementing a Matrix Class to Solve Linear Systems and Find Eigenvalues.**](projects/cppproject) We program a matrix class in C++. Operators have been overloaded to allow for robust, Matlab-like functionality. We implement Gaussian elimination, GMRES, QR and other numerical linear algebra algorithms. We verify our implementations by solving PDEs using the finite element method. 

- [**Modelling Neuronal Growth**](projects/mbproject). We investigate two different theories which model the growth of neurons in the brain. We build a coupled model which agrees with both theories in their respective regimes. We provide analytic solutions to the coupled model in a simplified case, and numerical solutions for the full PDE.
